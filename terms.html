        law.</p>
      <h3>2. Use License</h3>
      <ol type="a" class="px-3">
        <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
          Kwachabets'
          website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer
          of
          title, and under this license you may not:
          <ol type="i">
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Kwachabets' website;</li>
            <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
            <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
          Kwachabets at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this
          license,
          you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
      </ol>

          expressed
          or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
          warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
          intellectual
          property or other violation of rights.</li>
        <li>Further, Kwachabets does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

        materials on
        Kwachabets' website, even if Kwachabets or a Kwachabets authorized representative has been notified orally or in
        writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
